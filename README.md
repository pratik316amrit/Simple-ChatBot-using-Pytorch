Simple Chatbot with PyTorch
Welcome to the Simple Chatbot project! This repository contains the implementation of a basic chatbot using PyTorch. The chatbot uses a dataset in JSON format, which can be easily customized to alter the bot's behavior and responses.

Features
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation using PyTorch.
Customizable dataset in JSON format.
Basic NLP preprocessing and tokenization.
Training and inference scripts.

Dataset
The dataset is stored in a JSON file (data.json). The JSON structure is straightforward, making it easy to add, remove, or modify the intents and responses. Here's an example structure of the JSON file:
